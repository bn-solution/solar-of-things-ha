## Overview

The **Solar of Things** integration connects Home Assistant to the
[Siseli solar portal](https://solar.siseli.com) and provides:

- **Auto-discovery** of every inverter under your station — enter your Station ID once and Home Assistant finds all devices automatically.
- **10+ real-time sensors** updated every 5 minutes.
- **4 monthly summary sensors** for energy totals and solar coverage.
- **8 control entities** (sliders, dropdowns, switches) to manage battery limits, operating modes, and grid settings from HA.
- Full **Home Assistant Energy Dashboard** compatibility.
- **Multi-station support** — add the integration once per station.

> **Developed by [Conexo Casa](https://conexocasa.org)** — building accessible technology for people with neurocognitive impairments and the elderly.

---

## Support & Scope

This integration exists because the author owns a **Sumry 3600** inverter and
wanted it in Home Assistant. It's published here in case it's useful to anyone
else on the Siseli platform — not as a product with a support contract behind
it.

In practice, that means:

- **Bug fixes are best-effort**, made when the author has time, and prioritized
  toward the hardware they actually own and can test against.
- **Reports about other inverter models, WiFi dongle variants, or firmware
  families are genuinely welcome** — several real fixes in this project's
  history came directly from a detailed report (exact field names, a raw API
  capture, confirmed against real hardware). But a report alone doesn't
  guarantee a fix, especially for hardware the author has no way to verify
  against.
- **There's no SLA, no roadmap commitment, and no guarantee any specific
  device will ever be supported.**

**You're encouraged to fork this repository.** The code is MIT-licensed
specifically so you can adapt it to your own inverter, dongle, or firmware
without waiting on anyone. If you build a fix for your hardware, a pull
request back is very welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing) — but
forking and maintaining your own copy is a completely legitimate way to use
this project, not a fallback.

---

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in the HA sidebar → **Integrations**.
2. Click **⋮** (top-right) → **Custom repositories**.
3. Enter:
   ```
   https://github.com/Conexo-Casa/solar-of-things-ha
   ```
   Category: **Integration** → **Add**.
4. Search **Solar of Things** → **Download**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Manual

1. Download the latest release ZIP from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Conexo-Casa/solar-of-things-ha/releases/latest).
2. Extract and copy the `solar_of_things` folder to:
   ```
   /config/custom_components/solar_of_things/
   ```
3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

---

## Configuration

### Step 1 — Find Your Credentials

1. Open [https://solar.siseli.com](https://solar.siseli.com) and log in.
2. Note your **User ID** (login account name) and **password**.
3. Press **F12** → **Network** tab → refresh the page.
4. Click any request to `solar.siseli.com` and find `stationId` in the **Payload** tab.

| Value | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| **User ID** | Your account login name on solar.siseli.com |
| **Password** | Your account password |
| **Station ID** | `stationId` field in any API request payload |

### Step 2 — Add the Integration

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration**.
2. Search **Solar of Things**.
3. Choose **User ID + Password** (recommended) and fill in:

   | Field | Required | Description |
   |---|---|---|
   | **User ID** | ✅ | Your Siseli account login name |
   | **Password** | ✅ | Your Siseli account password |
   | **Station ID** | ✅ | Numeric `stationId` (usually 18 digits) — **not** your inverter or WiFi-dongle serial number |
   | **Device ID** | Optional | Leave blank to auto-discover all devices |
   | **Time zone** | Optional | Default: `Asia/Manila` |

4. Click **Submit**. The integration logs in, discovers devices, and creates all entities.

> **IOT Token mode** is also available for advanced users who prefer not to store credentials. Tokens expire and require re-entry when they do.

### Step 3 — Verify

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Solar of Things** and confirm your devices appear with sensors, controls, and monthly sensors populated.

> Entities show **Unknown** for the first 5 minutes while the first coordinator poll runs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "Cannot Connect" on setup | Wrong credentials or network | Check User ID / password and HA network access to solar.siseli.com |
| No devices discovered | Wrong Station ID | Re-read `stationId` from the portal Network tab. A serial number printed on the inverter or WiFi dongle is **not** the Station ID |
| Entities show "Unavailable" | Token expired or portal unreachable | HA will prompt re-auth automatically; check logs |
| Sensors always "Unknown" | API returns null for that field | Normal for sensors not supported by your inverter model |
| Controls do nothing | Settings endpoint varies by firmware | Check HA logs for HTTP status codes |
| Integration not in search | Files in wrong location | Verify `/config/custom_components/solar_of_things/` exists |

### Enable debug logging
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.solar_of_things: debug
```
Restart HA, reproduce the issue, then check **Settings → System → Logs**.

## Contributing

Adding support for hardware the maintainer doesn't own is exactly what forking
and contributing is for — see [Support & Scope](#support--scope). The fixes
most likely to get merged are the ones that came with a real capture against
real hardware, not a guess.

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes and ensure Python syntax is valid:
   ```bash
   python3 -m py_compile custom_components/solar_of_things/*.py
   ```
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description.
